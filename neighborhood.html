<h1>About Orem</h1>


<p class="description">Utah Valley Has been growing rapidly, and it's hard to recognize it from when I was a kid, but there's still plenty of family friendly things to do, and neat events.  Like, such as for instance the <a href="https://summerfest.orem.org/events/">Summer fest</a>.  Also there is <a href="https://www.nowplayingutah.com/event/open-chess-2/"> at the Orem Public Library</a></p>
